Collection of notes from courses taken or ongoing. I'm generalizing a course to be any contiguous and themeatically grouped set of content.

Please, note, I don't expect these personal notes to make sense to the casual observer.

As of mid 2018 I've begun adding retrospectives to courses that I take. That may be of interest. Also, note that I typically cap each course with a project that is outside of the course, or if was part of the course, represents pure independent work by me or in collaboration but not as some structured toy assignment with a solution.

These projects are the 'proof' I learned something from the course. You can typically identify them by taking a look through my repos and using some common sense.
