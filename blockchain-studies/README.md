This repo represents some materials, mostly notes, and some code that was written as part of a 'deep dive' into blockchain and the crypto space. Much of this is organized around a Bradfield course, but is not limited to that. All code in this repo (to my chagrin for much of it) is my own.

topics:
- the history of money
- distributed networks
- gossip protocols
- bitcoin
- nakamoto consensus, PoW, and the Fork Choice rule
- Ethereum and smart contracts
