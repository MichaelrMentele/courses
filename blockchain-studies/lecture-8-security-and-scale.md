# Security Problems
- fallback functions
- integer underflows, overflows
- inheritance
  - complexity is the enemy of security

# Notes
- Common pattern to deploy a contract to do attaching for your
- only contracts have fallback functions
- parity-wallet hack
- two main clients for ethereum (geth, parity)
- bake security into your blocckchain, constrain programmers, build a better security toolchain
- security tools; mythril, oyente, securify
- you want your code to get audited or use pre-audited components
  - open-zeppelin
- scaling:
  - latency
  - space on HD
  - cost
  - throughput
  - network size
  - security
