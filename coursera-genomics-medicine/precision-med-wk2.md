# Module 2: Genetic Testing for Mendellian Diseases
- testing accross the life span
    - pre-conception
    - prenatal
    - newborns
    - children
    - adults
- direct targeted sequencing (>100 bp)
    - single gene
    - panels
    - SNP genotyping
- whole genome sequencing
    - whole exome sequencing
    - whole genome woot woot!
    - cytogenomic array to scan for CNVs 
- use primers to amplify regions
- how do we catch dup/del?
- protect children's autonomy
    - don't tell for inactionable genetic disease for adult onset
    - genetic testing for carrier status should be defferred
- finding tests: genetests, genetic registry, eurogentests

# Module 3: Newborn Screening
- criteria
    - important health problem
    - early onset where intervention matters
    - cost effective to intervene
- ex: PKU
    - deficiency of phenylanlanine can't change to tyrosine
    - pre screening eliminate disabilities
    - if not treated leads to retardation
- mostly phontype based
    - deafness, cystic fibrosis, hypothyroidism, galactosemia...
    - fatty acid  disorders, organic acid, amino acid disorders by Tandem Mass spectroscopy (single test to shotgun many disorders)
    - congenital adrenal hyperplasia (that's me)
- scope
    - 31 core disorders and 26 secondary disorders
    - all states screening more than 30
- massive success
    - nearly all 4 million babies are screened
    - 12k are positive (0.3%)
    - every $1 spent on screening saves $10-20 (wow!) by averting medical costs
- future
    - more disorders?
    - criteria for utility?
    - how to bring in DNA seq and screening

# Model 4: Carrier Testing
- approaches
    - prenatal first half of prego
- guidelines
    - ACOG and ACMG
        - some guidelines different
- find asymptomatic carriers
    - who pays?
    - who decides?
- usually heterozygote carriers
    - most are autosomal recessive disorders
    - males and female equally affected
    - 1/4 chance for children whose parents who are carriers
- ethinicity based screening
    - frequency of diorders varies among groups
    - ashkenazi jewish, Tay Sachs disease...
    - Fr canadian
    - African, mediterranean etc.
    - problematics, less robust with multiculturism
- Tay Sachs disease
    - lysosomal storage disease
    - progressive neurodegeneration, no treatment or cure
    - one of first public health genetic programe
    - enzyme assay vs DNA
        - enzyme testing is better in this case
- Cystic Fibrosis
    - recommended, 1/25 is a carrier!!!
    - most common autosomal recessive disorder
    - CFTR has mutation
        - defective chloride transport, mucus buildup
    - pulmonary disease
    - 2000 genes identified... wowow
    - not well known/classified in asian and african
    - lot's of VUS... rare mutations hard to interpret, lack of data
        - note: data here seems really hard to collect..., we need every to get sequenced!!!
- Fragile X Syndrome
    - common form of retardation (one of the most common)
    - autism 1/4000 males
    - 1/150 women carry this
    - population screening not recommended
        - hotly debated
    - genetic counsyling complicated
    - FMR1 has premutation can expand to full mutation
        - copy number
        - fuzzy line for have it or don't
- multiplex screening allows testing
    - cheap
    - offer to everyone!?
        - cost effective
        - universal screening
    - cons
        - 35% will have findings, need to screen partner
- trend -> broad spectrum screening and universal panels
    - decrease risk
- purpose of prenatal screening is to fulfill reproductive goals for a couple

# Prenatal Diagnosis
- MIT tech review (NIPS is cutting edge)
- screening tests
    - risk factors: age, biochemical screening, serum?
    - cell free dna
    - ultra sound nuchal translucency
- diagnostic tests
    - amniocentesis
- looking for aneuploidy
- integrated screening
    - first trimester
        - PAPP-A
        - hCG
        - nuchal translucency
        - all increased in babies with down
    - second trimester
- nuchal translucency
    - fluid behind neck
    - more fluid in fetuses with down
- detection rate has ----> 100% for down with NIPS
- what is amniocentesis?
- age increases aneuploides
- need standards -> ACOG practice guidelines
    - NOT JUST REcommended on age
    - available to all
- women actually see defect as >>> as risk of procedures
- amniocentesis, put a needle into the uterus, take 10% of fluid from amniotic sack
    - miscarriage risk
- chorionic villus sampling (CVS)
    - take villi from developing placenta
    - advantage is that test is done earlier
- cell free dna!
    - discovered in serum of pregos, pretty amazing
    - combined with NGS
    - comes from apoptosis
    - mostly from the placenta
    - 10% from fetus in womens maternal plasma
    - gone within a few hours after delivery
    - challenges
        - not enough material
        - placenta isn't necessarily the same as the fetus genetically
            - twins where one dies as ex.
    - no way to tell what is maternal or fetal
- chromosomal microarray (CMA)
- what is karyotype?
    - low resolution of appearance/count of chromosomes
