# Module 1: mendelian vs. complex
- environmental disease
- genetic diseases
- some are primarily genetic vs. environment but this is a spectrum
    - these are 'complex' diseases
- mendelian
    - clear inheritance pattern
        - dominant vs recessive
        - high penetrance
- complex
    - no clear inheritance pattern
    - phenocopies
        - non-genetic form of disease
    - incomplete penetrance
        - genetic risk not certainty
        - can be age related with gene risk factors
    - variable expressivity
        - makes sense to me, need to understand the actual mechanisms
    - low penetrance
    - common diseases, multiple causes
        - tough to establish causation
- symptoms of genetic disease
    - inheritance
    - early onset
    - incidence in unlikely sex
    - absence of known risk factors
- finding diseases
    - 70's candidate gene association studies
        - curious on gene
        - variations == disease?
        - on populations
    - 80's found disease via linkage analysis
        - genome wide markers
        - families, multiple generations
            - co-inheritance for genetic markers
    - mid 2000's genome wide association study (GWAS)
        - due to human genome project
        - now we can use NGS for rare variants
    - linkage and NGS good for mendelian disease
    

# M2: GWAS Method
- common disease due to cuulative effect of low penetrance variants
- common disease, rare variant -> high penetrance variants
    - multiple vectors to get to the disease
- genotyping
    - 1 million SNPs in one experiment
    - what is a tag SNP?
        - common static patterns
    - genotyping arrays
- study designs
    - cohort studies
        - disease free -> follow over time
            - those with get disease, who has genetic variant?
        - problems:
            - large for rare diseases
            - follow for a long time to get data
    - case-control studies
        - peeps with disease
        - peeps without
        - make comparision
        - more prone to bias/confounding
            - confounder -> related to genotype and disease not a cause (race/ethnicity)
                - confounder in diabetes
            - false positive or negative?
            - misclassification bias
                - erroneously classified as controls
                - genotype status
                    - error with calling
    - case control studies are more pront to confounding
        - harder to match up controls right
    - observational in nature
        - can't distribute genotypes :P

# M3: GWAS Analysis
- statistical testing
    - is the distribution due to chance?
- what about how many copies there are?
- what is a p value mean of 0.05 mean?
    - less than 5% chance of false positive ie. occurred by random chance
- the more tests done the lower the p value should be required
- manhattan plot?
- true association (true positive)
    - genotype direct causal
    - linked to causal variant (indirect)
- false
    - by chance
    - confounding/bias
- valid association
    - not due to chance
    - bias free
    - reproducible

# M4: GWAS Interpretation
- calculation of risk
    - will I get the disease?
    - calculate from cohort study
- why don't we have a model?
- relative risk
- can we do this for case-control studies?
    - no
    - fixed disease and controls
- can calc odds of disease
    - similar to absolute risk of disease
- generalizability (external validity)
    - study represents population of applciation
- most GWAS done in eurpeans, can associate generally???
    - most do generalize, the risk estimate varies
    - especially for african

# M5: Genetics of Common and Complex Disease
- as of 2014 1836 publications and 13000 SNPs finding tons of diseases
- many SNPs associated with diseases
    - 41 for diabetes explains 60% of variation
    - 180 loci's for height but only explain %12
- limitations
    - common SNPs not tagged
    - not capturing rare variants
    - CNVs?
    - epistatic (gene-gene)
    - gene environment interaction

# Notes
- we basically do regression analysis to find genetic factors for disease
    - so slow and burdensome
