# M1: Clinical Validity
- predictive testive
    - when asymptomatic, likelihood will they get the disease
- ex tests
    - familial breast, colorectal cancer
        - BRCA1/2
        - MMR genes
- ACCE model
    - evaluating genomic tests systematically for clinical use
    - analytical validity
        - accuracy of assay (sensitivity and specificity)
        - CLIA (Clinical Lab Improvements Amendments)
    - clinitcal validity
        - does it predict the disease?
            - clinical sensitivity
            - clinical specificity
            - ppv (positive predictive value)
                - with positive test will you get disease
                    - penetrance measure
            - npv
                - with negative test, how many will remain disease free
            - population dependent
    - clinical utility
        - improve health outcomes?
        - can you intervene?
        - benefit vs. risk of test
    - societal implications
- evidence reports are basis for insurance coverage!
