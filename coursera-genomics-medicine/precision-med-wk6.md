# M1: background
- drug response 25-80% working in peeps
- adverse drug reactions for many
- pharmacogenomics
    - use peeps dna to improve how a drug works on someone.
    - ADME -> Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination
    - most impact distribution and metabolism
- many drugs metabolized by cytochrome p450 enzymes
    - polymorphic among individuals
        - can impact their metabolic rate, uptake?
        - activity varies by race
    - codeine (pro-drug) -> CYP2D6 -> morphine -> binds to target
    - if can't metabolize due to genes need much higher dose to achieve metabolism
    - two cases
        - metabolize too fast
        - metabolize too slow
- pharmacokinetics how the drug moves around the body
- pharmacodynamics
    - how drug effects body
- offtarget effects
    - binds to target and unintended target
        - like collateral damage

# M2: pharmocogenic tests
- put gene-drug pairs in label of drugs
- 12% of approved drugs so far
- doesn't mean the label is clinically validated
- most markers in oncology
- half of non-cancer refer to:
    - CYP2C9
    - CYP2C19
    - CYP2D6
- pharmGKB
    - decided to rank pharmicogenomic
        - testing required
        - testing recommended
    - not many required or recommended
    - drug labels...
        - pharmacogenomics is is all over the place on the label
    - what is myopathy?

# M3: Is my Patient a Candidate?
- what is epthelial?
- many variants cause Cystic fibrosis
    - mess up the chloride channel
- avoid severe adverse reactions
- efficacy of drug dependent on variants
- what is thrombotic?
- factors besides genetics?
    - sex, age, race, concomitant drugs, other
    - but really most of this is genetics end of day
    - genetics, environment, age
- turn around time matters
    - something that can happen in hours
    - whole genome sequencing in advance
- many private insurance follow medicare

# M4: where to get and interpret
- pharmagkb.org knowledge base
    - assays available, genetic testing registry managed by NIH
- CLIA certified lab big deal (analytical validity)


# Key vocab
- sensitivity
- specificity
- ppv and npv
