# M1: Cancer bio
- mortality 50%
- second leading cause of death
- 1 in 3 affected
- cancer is a genetic disease
- usually happens in cancer first
- biology of cancer
    - mitosis regulated by cell cycle controllers, growth factors, and receptors that induce or inhibit proliferations
    - cancer bypass growth signalling and lose growth control
    - multiplies uncontrollably
        - metastisize means it migrates to other parts of the body
- cancer is a genetic disease
    - loss of growth control due to mutations in the DNA
    - damage is repaired by dna enzymes
    - happens in division
- cancer genes
    - oncogenes
        - proto-oncogenes
        - normal involved in cell cycle signals
        - on switch for division
        - proto-oncogenes -> oncogenes
            - gain a function to bypass the signalling process
        - why don' we engineer humans to be immune to cancer? include a backup system
    - DNA repair
        - excision repair
        - recombinational repair
        - mismatch repair
    - tumor suppressors
        - slow cell growth
        - off switch
        - signal apoptosis
    - chromatin modifiers (epigentics)
        - mutations in epigentic machinery
        - methylation turns off gene
        - global hypomethylation
        - promoter-specific hypermethlyation
- model of carcinogensesis
    - driver mutations
    - multi stage
    - cascade effect
    - multi-year process
- tumor not homegenous
    - mutations accumulate and diverge

# M2: hereditary cancer
- heritiability tracked by familial recurrence risk
- tumors in same organ
- hereditary breast cancer
    - 5-10% hereditary
    - complex disease
    - BRCA1/2, breast and ovarian cancer
    - 50% unexplained
- knudson's 2 hit hypothesis tumor suppression
    - sporadic cancer, both genes mutated, more unlikely
    - inherited born with one gene mutated

# M3: Tumor genetic landscape
- resources:
    - cancergenome
    - cosmic database
    - cancer genome atlas
- characteristic
    - 33-66 genes mutated in solid tumors
    - mostly SNPs
    - varies by cancer types
- driver mutations
    - common mutation frequencies
    - many passenger mutations
    - mutation patterns
- 3300 tumors sequences
- 125 mutation dirver genese identified
- 71 tumor suppressor genes
- 54 oncogenes
- metastatic disease
    - brain
    - liver
    - lung
    - lymph
    - 90% of cancer deaths metastatic

# M4: Clinical applications
- molcular markers to classify cancers
