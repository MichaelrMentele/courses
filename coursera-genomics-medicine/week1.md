Module 3: SNP
- somatic changes are mutations in gametes
- human mutation rate is 10^8 per bp per generation
  - a new born has acquired 50-100 mutations per newborn on average
  - de novo is (new) mutations
- mutation arises, offspring spread that mutation through descent not by recurrent mutation
- allele frequency of SNPs can change based on genetic drift or natural selection
- classification of minor allele freq is rare <0.5%, low is 0.5-5% and >5% we call it a common vairiant

Module 4:
- mutation in promoter region (SNV/SNP) can affect gene expression
- splice site SNV can disrupt splicing exons together
- mutations occuring in the coding region of the gene can impact proteins
- some mutations have no effect on synonmyous triplet codons code for the same protein
- missense mutations are non-synonmyous where a SNP in a triplet codon codes for a different protein
- triplet codons code for 20 amino acids
- a frameshift mutation is an indel
- average person has 3-4 million SNPs but 55k end up in genes
- half in coding region only about 350 can cause loss of function

Module 5: Architecture of Human Genetic Variation
- genes make proteins
- mutations effects on genes
- methods to find genes linked to genes?
- haplotypes? -> co-inherited alleles
- recombination breaks up haplotypes
- linkage disequilibrium -> correlation between locuses
- alleles in haplotype are said to be in linkage
- linkage is bigger with proximity
- haplotype block regions that are crossed over together
- haplotype blocks are independent of genes? whaat? how are these blocks determined?
- haplotype blocks vary by race, interesting!
- SNPs are most common variant

Quiz:
- exons contain code for proteins

Cues:
- SNP vs. SNV
- newborn has 50-100 mutations (de novo)
- codons are?
- introns vs. exons
- what is haplotype?
- genes independent of recombinant blocks
- linkage diequilibrium?
