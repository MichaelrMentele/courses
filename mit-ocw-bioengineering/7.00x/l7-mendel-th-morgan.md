# Notes
- wildtype: is the 'normal' phenotype expected in the 'wild'

# Goals:
- describe how experimentation showed that both Mendelâ€™s rules for inheritance and the chromosomal theory of inheritance are valid.
- describe the relationship of non-Mendelian inheritance to meiosis.

# Objectives: Students should be able to...
- Design a genetic cross that can determine whether two or more genes are linked or unlinked.
- Calculate the recombination frequency between two or more genes.
- Predict the outcome of genetic crosses involving linked genes.
- Determine the recombinant and non-recombinant genotypes of progeny resulting from a genetic cross involving linked genes.
- Construct a genetic map from recombination frequencies.
- Describe the relationship of non-Mendelian inheritance to meiosis.
- Predict the results of a genetic cross involving genes carried on the sex chromosomes.
