You can determine polarity betwen the relative difference between the electronegativity of two elements. This has various scales (Pauling electronegativity is common).

Nitrogen OR Oxygen ~= polar molecule

- what is a 'functional group'?
- how is polarity determined for a molecule?
- how can you heuristically determine if a molecule is polar or not?
