The main idea is that in the 20th century we tried to understand life through the lens of biochemistry and genetics. They didn't have a way to talk until the late 1900's when molecular biology came about. Towards the 21st century recombinant DNA and genomics allowed us to easily experimentally connect genes to proteins and proteins to genes and isolate genes and insert them into other organisms and tissues and test their effects in isolation.
