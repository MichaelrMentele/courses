# History
The idea of vitalism existed until the late 1890's until Buchner won the nobel prize in chemistry for showing that yeast juice (non-life) could carry on fermentation without being part of a living cell.

# Covalent bonds
- polar bonds (little magnets)
- non-polar bonds
- electro negativity
- strong and stable 80 kcal/mol

# Non-covalent bonds
- london dispersion forces (little magnet interactions)
- 5 kcal/mol in strength in the hydrogen bonds
- water highly structured via hydrogen bonds
- ionic bonds are little magnet to magnet (dipole bonds), not sharing but the donating of electrons
- van der waals force, the fluctuation of the charge moving around (even if non-polar), bonds entrain eachother and make little magnets moving back and forth swapping back and forth... this sounds just like a flip flop... 
- strength of a van der waals force is 1 kcal/mol (geckos are able to use this to walk on walls)

# Hydrophobic "Forces"
- not forces at all really but non-polar molecules can disrupt a polar molecule
- oil and water separate b/c fats (hydro carbons) are non-polar so can't form hydrogen bonds

# Understanding Properties of Molecules
- cell membranes are hydrophobic lipid walls
- hydrophobic separates from water
- dehydration synthesis forms triglycerides (hydrophobic)
- micelle and lipid bilayer (membrane)

# ATP and Carbs
- Adenosine tri phosphate (ATP)
- sugar with 6 carbons is a hexose, pentose is 5 carbons, 3 carbons triose
- glucose is a hexose
- disacharides can bond together in long chains or all sorts of different formations
- covalent bonds, hydrogen bons, ionics bonds, van der waals, hydrophobic bonds
