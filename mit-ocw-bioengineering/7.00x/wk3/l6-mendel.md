# Notes
- Mendel carefully selected peas (don't spray pollen everywhere)
- bred them 2 years to show they would breed true on a variety of traits
- he started with controls!
- then experiments start
- he counted and tabulated results!
- model: uses model of two particles to predict crossing behavior
- gene: discrete factor of inheriticance
- allele: alternative types of a gene
- genotype: specced by alleles
- homozygote: two of same alleles A/A
- heterozygote: two diff alleles A/a
- phenotype: appearance or trait, expression of a genotype
- phenotypes are dominant/recessive
- cytology: viewing things under the microscope
- chromosome: colored thing (haha)
- mitosis: chromosomes line up in middle of a cell then pull apart
- meiosis: for sex cells, first cell division splits the pairs of chromosomes
- chromsome theory of inheritance! backing mendel up woot woot

# Goals as Questions:
- how did experimentation result in Mendelâ€™s laws of inheritance.
- what is the relationship of Mendelian inheritance to meiosis.

# Objectives: Students should be able to...
- Accurately use common genetic terms with regards to Mendel.
- how can you predict the outcome of genetic crosses involving one or two unlinked genes?
- how can you determine the genotypes of individuals given the resulting progeny from a genetic cross?
- Design a genetic cross that can determine whether a trait is dominant or recessive.
- Design a genetic cross that can determine the genotype of an individual.
- Describe the relationship of meiosis to Mendelian inheritance and Punnett squares.
