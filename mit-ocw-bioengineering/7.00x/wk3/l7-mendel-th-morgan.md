# Notes
- wildtype: is the 'normal' phenotype expected in the 'wild'

# Goals:
- describe how experimentation showed that both Mendelâ€™s rules for inheritance and the chromosomal theory of inheritance are valid.
- describe the relationship of non-Mendelian inheritance to meiosis.

# Objectives: Students should be able to...
- Design a genetic cross that can determine whether two or more genes are linked or unlinked.
- Calculate the recombination frequency between two or more genes.
- Predict the outcome of genetic crosses involving linked genes.
- Determine the recombinant and non-recombinant genotypes of progeny resulting from a genetic cross involving linked genes.
- Construct a genetic map from recombination frequencies.
- Describe the relationship of non-Mendelian inheritance to meiosis.
- Predict the results of a genetic cross involving genes carried on the sex chromosomes.

# Lectures
## Linkage Maps
Purely by observation of mutants the RELATIVE positioning of genes to eachother could be determined. Sturtevant discovered this in an all nighter one day reviewing all the data that Morgan and team had been collecting.

## Sex Chromosomes and Sex Linkages
1910 finds the white eyed mutant. How's the fly haha.

xx is homogametic vs. xy which is heterogametic

How does the white eyed fly help us?

Setup a cross: wht male x wt female

It looks recessive. But he crosses it again and females never have white eyes but 50% of the males do.
