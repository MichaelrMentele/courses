# Notes
What is engineering? Engineers are scientists that apply technology to create new things.

Design is part and parcel to engineering. How can I build primitives that I can compose to create novel behaviors?

Engineers specialize in a specific branch of physics and apply that physics to constructing technology.

Measure, model, manipulate, create. You need to be able to create a manipulatable model where you can edit and iterate to design new tech.

How does engineering fit into biology? Technically applying a branch of engineering to the domain of medicine is biomedical engineering.

Bioengineering is a conglomeration of a little bit of this and that borrowed from the other disciplines.

We started out in biomedical devices where ME and EE's created devices that were used in the body.

What is a bioreactor? Biomatter that creates useful proteins.

Bioengineering hasn't been a thing until recently because we couldn't do analysis because we didn't understand how tissues work. How microbiology works. 

Two revolutions happened:
1. molecular biology
2. genomics
