groups of the periodic table:
- columns of periodic table
- all elements in a column have similar properties because they tend to have the same number of valence electrons
- group 1 (excepting hyrdrogen) are the alkaline metals
- what is the octet rule?
- alkali metals are very reactive, they are shiny and soft
- group 2 are alkaline earth metals, more stable than alkaline metals but still reactive (easier to lose two electrons than gain 6)
- group 17 is the halogens and they love to interact with alkali metals
- the noble gases don't like to react because they are at a stable amount of electrons.
- who invented the periodic table Dmitri Mendeleev
- columns are groups and rows are periods that share properties that determine physical state and reactivity
- what is chemical reactivity? forming bonds with other elements
- what is the relative atomic mass?
- is energy release or stored when an electron moves to an outer shell? stored
- if it moves to an inner shell it releases energy in the form of heat
- atoms tend to take on the lowest energy most stable configuration
- shell 1n holds 2 electrons
- shell 2n holds 8 electrons
- shell 3n holds 18 electrons
- what is a valence shell? the outermost shell
- what is the octet rule? most atoms want 8 electrons in their outermost shell
- what are the subshell designations?
- what are the types of bonds?
  - atoms that want to give and atoms that want to take to become stable, all atoms want to look like a noble gas, these together can form an ionic bond, because one offloads an electron and the other takes one and they are polarized and want to stick together
  - an ion is a positive or negative element
  - cation is positive
  - anion is negative
  - what is a covalent bond? a covalent bond is where they want to share electrons, this is typical of elements that don't want to give up or give away all of their electrons
  - a polar coavlent bond is where one side of the molecule is more engative or positive
  - what is the metalic bond?
- what is a electronegativy? when you are sharing electrons how badly does the element want to hog the electrons
- what is electro affinity? how much do you want more electrons
- what region of the periodic table is most electronegative? why? what about electropositive?
- what is an intermolecular force?
- what is an intramolecular force?
- what is a dipole?
- what is an electrostatic attraction? what does this have to do with boiling points?
- what is hydrogen bonding?
- what is FON?
- what are london dispersion forces?
- what is a hyrdrocarbon?
- what is an electrolyte?
