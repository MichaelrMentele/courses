# M1.2 The Stack
Amazing thing to note is that any program can be broken down into operations for this stack machine with just the following functions:
- add, subtract, negate
- lt, gt, eq
- and, or, not

It is so elegant we can represent all the execution frames of functions on the call stack... In the same stack! It just saves the data right on the stack... Not sure how that saving works--there must be some complex memory management in the RAM to slice this up correctly

The two step compilation is so interesting as well. Everyone should learn programming because it teaches you how to break problems down with abstractions into independent orthogonal pieces. Abstractions from the transistor all the way to your web program

It is interesting--what is the abstractions on tops of modern application programming? Viewing the glomming of systems as an abstraction? Why have we stopped evolving? Or have we? If you think about Counsel many ystems abstract away the complexity of a prudcut and user experience... Wow. A business is basically code... Fascinating idea!!
