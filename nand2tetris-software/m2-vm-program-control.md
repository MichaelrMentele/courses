This is complicated. And interesting. It's fascinating to peel back the layers and peek under the skirt of computing.

The more magic I understand the _more_ impressed I am with human accomplishment--it's amazing.

Our ability to build abstractions has allowed us to get this far. Simplifying by hiding and pulling complexity down... Wow!

In this session most of the content was around how defining functions and branching works. To be honest a lot of it didn't stick--it was pretty detailed and specific rules--the type of thing I don't remember well--because I can look that up in the spec. So the best way to understand this module is by doing.
