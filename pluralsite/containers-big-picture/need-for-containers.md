The problem is that we have snowflake of software. Downloading and installing software has a lot of questions. Install is different between products. Configuring items between operating systems. Different installing between OS's. There could be dependencies it requires. Could be conflicts with other software on your box.

How do you control the piece of software so it doesn't hog resources. How do you uninstall?

Main problem is you have to know a lot about the software just to use it.

Main concerns:
- getting the software
- installing
- running
